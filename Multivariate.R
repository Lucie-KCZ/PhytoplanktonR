plot(res.4th, alpha = .05, stat = "D2")

# Blue cells correspond to negative significant relationships and
# red cells correspond to positive significant relationships. 

# 'alpha' is a the significance level

# In this example, there are some associations between categorical traits and 
# quantitative environmental variables which can be measured in three different ways. 
# These methods correspond to three possible values of the 'stat' argument in the plot and print functions:
  
# stat = 'D2': the association is measured between the quantitative variable and 
#               each category seperately. A correlation coefficient is used to indicate 
#               the strength of the association between the given category and 
#               the small or large values of the quantitative variables.
# stat = 'G': the association between the quantitative variable and the whole categorical variable 
#             is measured by a global statistic (F).
# stat = 'D': the association is estimated between the quantitative variable and 
#               each category separately by a measure of the within-group homogeneity. 
#               The strength of the association is indicated by the dispersion of the values 
#               of the quantitative variable for a given category.
